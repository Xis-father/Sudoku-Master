# Sudoku-Master
This is an android sudoku game developed on the structure of surfaceview.
By using the sudoku generator, we've generated 5000 sudoku filled matrixs. Then we devided these matrix into 4 pieces for different difficulty levels.
To get the solvable puzzles, we used the backward-method to unfill the matrix.
If there is any question about the process of generating the puzzles or the project structure, contact us as bellow:
